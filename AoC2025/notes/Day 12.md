#### Phishing Techniques
- Impersonation
- Social Engineering (The manipulation of individuals to divulge sensitive information, through various forms of communication)
- Typosquatting and Punycode
- Spoofing
- Malicious Attachments
- Legitimate Applications
- Fake Login Pages
- Side Channel Communications

***Impersonation:** Is a type of Social Engineering. The attacker is pretending to be McSkidy*
**Typosquatting and Punycode**: Typosquatting is when an attacker registers a common misspelling of an organisation's domain. For example, `glthub.com` instead of `github.com` (note that there is an `L` instead of an `i`).

**Punycode:**
Punycode is a special encoding system that converts Unicode characters (used in writing systems like Chinese, Cyrillic, and Arabic) into ASCII. When typing punycodes in the browser URL bar, this will be translated into ASCII format, which is the accepted format by DNS.
Below we can see an image showing the **tryhackme.com** domain written with **тrу** instead (Cyrillic `т`, Cyrillic `г`, Cyrillic `у`): **тrуhackme.com**
