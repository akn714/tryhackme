### PCAP
Packet capture (PCAP) is a networking practice involving the interception of data packets travelling over a network. Once the packets are captured, they can be stored by IT teams for further analysis. The inspection of these packets allows IT teams to identify issues and solve network problems affecting daily operations.

### Zeek
Zeek (formerly Bro) is the world's leading platform for network security monitoring. Flexible, open source, and powered by defenders.

### RITA
Real Intelligence Threat Analytics (RITA) is an open-source framework created by Active Countermeasures. Its core functionality is to detect command and control (C2) communication by analyzing network traffic captures and logs.

### C2
Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure are a set of programs used to communicate with a victim machine. This is comparable to a reverse shell, but is generally more advanced and often communicate via common network protocols, like HTTP, HTTPS and DNS.

### NSM (Network Security Monitoring)
Network Security Monitoring is based upon the collection of data to perform detection and analysis. With the collection of a large amount of data, it makes sense that a SOC should have the ability to generate statistical data from existing data, and that these statistics can be used for detection and analysis.

#### SPAN ports
SPAN port is used to copy traffic from one port to another for monitoring.

### VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
The VNC (Virtual Network Computing) protocol, officially known as **[RFB (Remote Framebuffer)](https://www.google.com/search?q=RFB+%28Remote+Framebuffer%29&oq=vnc+protocol&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOdIBCDc3NzNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&ved=2ahUKEwj99IOs-NORAxWA4zgGHUL3AWEQgK4QegYIAQgAEAU)**, is a platform-independent way to remotely control another computer by transmitting its graphical desktop (screen updates, keyboard, and mouse input) over a network

### IoC
In cybersecurity, an **Indicator of Compromise (IOC)** is digital evidence or a digital "breadcrumb" (like a malicious IP, file hash, or unusual network traffic) found on a network or system that signals a security breach or ongoing cyberattack
