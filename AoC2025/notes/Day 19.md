## What is SCADA?

SCADA systems are the "command centres" of industrial operations. They act as the bridge between human operators and the machines doing the work. Think of SCADA as the nervous system of a factory—it senses what's happening, processes that information, and sends commands to make things happen.

## **What is a PLC?**

A PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) is an industrial computer designed to control machinery and processes in real-world environments. Unlike your laptop or smartphone, PLCs are purpose-built machines engineered for extreme reliability and harsh conditions.

## What is Modbus?

Modbus is the communication protocol that industrial devices use to talk to each other. Created in 1979 by Modicon (now Schneider Electric), it's one of the oldest and most widely deployed industrial protocols in the world. Its longevity isn't due to sophisticated features—quite the opposite. Modbus succeeded because it's simple, reliable, and works with almost any device.

Think of Modbus as a basic request-response conversation:

- **Client** (your computer): "PLC, what's the current value of register 0?"
- **Server** (the PLC): "Register 0 currently holds the value 1."
