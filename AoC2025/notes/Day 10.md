**Triaging** helps security teams identify which alerts deserve immediate attention, which can be deprioritised, and which can be safely ignored for a moment. The process separates chaos from clarity, allowing analysts like McSkidy's SOC team to focus their time and resources where it truly matters.

**Persistence**
Malware often tries to keep a footprint in the system such that it keeps running even after a system restart. This is called persistence. For example, If a malware adds itself to the startup registry keys, it will persist even after a system restart.

**Triage**: Triage is the process of sorting and prioritizing people or tasks based on urgency and severity.

##### These four represent the essential dimensions of triage:
- **Severity:** How bad?
- **Time:** When?
- **Context:** Where in the attack lifecycle?
- **Impact:** Who or what is affected?
